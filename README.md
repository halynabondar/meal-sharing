## What I Learned

<p>During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building a Star component for leaving a rating for a meal, a Modal component.</p>

<p>Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with Express.js, KnexJS, and MySQL to build a full-stack web application.</p>

<p>In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.</p>

<p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.</p>
